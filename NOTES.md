<!-- TODO: Limitations -->
    - 1) Would be nice to show query instructions on the UI, perhaps a modal on initial render, and a button that renders the modal on click
    - 2) Like-state maintained in local storage persist for any similarly indexed card - need unique identifier in backend for proper state mgmt

    TroubleShooting Bugs:

    **NOTE: if query a date, you don't receive a JSON Array, but rather a string
    **NOTE: count=integer and start_date to end_date return JSON Arrays

    a) Currently, once a specific card's like button is clicked for the first time, state is maintained upon refresh
    b) if user makes a new query, the first card to return will have it's like button showing as active; however, if refreshed on this same card, active state is removed.  IF user return's to original card, the state is also gone.  YET a refresh on the original card will return the active state on the like button
